<p>One of my earliest memories is sitting in my grandpa's living room at about age 7, everyone is gathered around the answering machine. This was 1992 and the answering machine was cutting edge tech.  I saw my uncle getting frustrated trying to figure it out. Being young and fearless, I stepped in to look at it myself. I hit a few buttons and to everyone’s surprise, especially mine, I got it to work. </p>

<p>Growing up was much of the same experience with tech, having no idea what I’m doing but taking a risk to step in and figure it out.</p>

<p>I started out as a Computer Science major in college, but crippling math anxiety caused me to back out and study business instead. I worked 9 to 5 office jobs in marketing after college. It was fun when I got to be creative but overall, I wasn’t that excited about it.</p>

<p>After listening to The Four Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss on my morning commute to work, I was inspired to quit my job and travel the world solo for four months. I started on the west coast  in Malibu, up to San Francisco and then spent six weeks in Hawaii, swimming with dolphins, watching lava pour into the ocean and jumping off a forty foot cliff into the Pacific. Next I sailed two weeks across the Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda to England. I spent two weeks in Morocco and finally a week in Italy before heading home.</p>

<p>One of my biggest takeaways was commiting to the idea that I would never settle for a mediocre career again, I would only do what I was passionate about. After exploring different pathways, from ballroom dance instructor to pottery maker, I eventually felt inspired to revisit my days as a Computer Science major. I enrolled in the online post-baccalaureate program at Oregon State University. This time I conquered my fear in math, landing a 3.9 GPA after two semesters, however I was lured away by the sudden success of a business idea. </p>

<p>For the next few years, I lived the life of an entrepreneur, starting with an online retail business and then moving into online marketing services. There were highs and lows and I learned a lot about myself, eventually realizing that although I had gotten closer, I was still missing the mark when it came to my dream career.</p>

<p>I decided to once again return to my early roots, troubleshooting hardware (and software) for Sunoco LP. The tech has moved beyond the answering machine but the principles remain the same, don’t be afraid to fail and keep failing until you don’t. This has honestly been an incredible experience, I’ve excelled more than I have at any other position and my confidence has reached new levels. I knew I was getting closer than ever to that dream career by entering the tech world, but now it was time to find my niche.</p>

<p>My next step has been entering the Full Stack Web Development program at the Flatiron School. It’s been a tremendous challenge at some points and utterly exhilarating throughout. I am on the precipice of landing that dream career as I work my way through my current chapter, landing my first job as a Full Stack Web Developer.
