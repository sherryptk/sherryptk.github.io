<p>I have been meaning to learn to code for the last 10 years. From backing out of a Computer Science major because of a crippling math anxiety to finally committing myself to learn to code by entering Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development program, it's been a long journey. But how cool is it that I'm doing this now? From the time I was in second grade figuring out how to program my grandpa's answering machine, I've had a knack and love for tech. I'm thrilled to finally embrace this part of myself and share my experiences along the way.</p>
