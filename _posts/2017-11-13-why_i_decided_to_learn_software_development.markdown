I've had an on again off again relationship with coding since college. One of my very first majors was Computer Science but funny story, my cat had kittens and I decided I was meant for a future in nursing. Computers were put on hold and I ended up graduating with a degree in business. I worked in marketing for several years until I came across Tim Ferriss's *Four Hour Work Week*. I was so inspired by the idea of not working a typical 9-5 office job that I quit my marketing position and traveled the world by myself for four months. This was a fantastic adventure and I swore I would never work an office job again. A few weeks after returning home, I started working an office job again. It paid well and I came home from my adventures very broke. It was around this time I started to dream about a future in software development again.  I wanted a career that I could do remotely so I could continue traveling. I started an HTML/CSS course but didn't finish.

About a year later, I was laid off from my marketing job. Luckily for me, in the meantime, I had been researching ways of working for myself and had developed an online retail business, mainly selling on Amazon. The business had grown to match my income in marketing so I decided to be a full time business owner. This actually left me with a lot of free time and I started taking free classes on Coursera. One of the first was a 101 computer science class offered by a Stanford professor. I was so excited, I fell in love coding. It was challenging and confusing and so satisfying when I got it right. I ended up enrolling in the Oregon State University online post-baccealeaute computer science program. 

After two semesters at OSU, my business life took over and I didn't have the same time I used to. For the next few years, I focused on building my business. I realized after time that this was an ok way to make a living, but not inspiring or something I was passionate about.   I eventually came across Flatiron's coding bootcamp which reignited my passion for coding. I decided this time I would follow through, learn something I loved doing and pursue a career in it. That brings me to today, sharing my adventures in learning to code, excited to see what unfolds.
